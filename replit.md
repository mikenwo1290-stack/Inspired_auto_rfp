# AutoRFP - Project Setup Status

## Overview
AutoRFP is an AI-powered RFP (Request for Proposal) response platform built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase authentication, PostgreSQL database, and AI services (OpenAI, LlamaIndex).

## Project Status: In Progress
Fresh GitHub import setup for Replit environment - currently debugging server startup issues.

## Recent Changes (Sept 25, 2025)
### Completed:
1. ✅ Set up PostgreSQL database connection using Replit's database service
2. ✅ Configured environment variables in `.env.local`
3. ✅ Installed dependencies with legacy peer deps resolution 
4. ✅ Ran Prisma migrations successfully - all 14 migrations applied
5. ✅ Modified Next.js config for Replit environment (host binding, cache control)
6. ✅ Updated package.json dev script to bind to 0.0.0.0:5000
7. ✅ Created AutoRFP Server workflow on port 5000
8. ✅ Temporarily disabled Supabase authentication in middleware for development mode

### Current Issue:
- Next.js compilation hangs on root page (/) compilation
- Server starts but doesn't complete initial page compilation
- Root page redirects to /organizations but compilation never finishes
- Likely caused by OrganizationProvider making API calls during SSR without proper data

### Next Steps:
- Debug organization context API calls
- Consider adding database seed data for initial organizations
- Set up proper Supabase integration if needed
- Test application functionality once compilation completes

## Project Architecture

- Prefer fixing/debugging over rewriting from scratch
- Focus on getting basic functionality working first before full feature implementation
